            <span class="c1">Consider your scenes in improvisation in the same manner of rearing a child. The absolute worst thing you can do in either is to be apathetic...Lack of emotion is lethal. It will kill every scene. Love, anger, hatred, lust—all go a long way to show urgency, desire, and caring in every scene. - p. 11</span>
            <span class="c1">It’s possible that the audience figured it out before you did, but by the time you finally spit it back to them they were bored and annoyed that it took you so long to catch up to them. - p. 15</span>
            <span class="c1">Try to kill the audience. Fucking kill them. I want you to make them laugh so hard they vomit and choke on their own vomit. - p. 34</span>
            <span class="c1">You need to consciously invest more concern in your scene partner than in yourself so that you can explore all the facets of your existence and environment. - p. 39</span>
            <span class="c1">You have to treat your scene partners like artists and poets. When you lower yourself to play retards and obese people, you pander to the audience and you insult your scene partner, the audience, and me. - p. 40</span>
            <span class="c1">Wear your characters like a trenchcoat. - p. 40</span>
            <span class="c1">A thousand cheap laughs can never compare to one intelligent chuckle. - p. 40</span>
            <span class="c1">Laughter is a response to a gestalt formation where two previously incompatible or dissimilar ideas suddenly form into a new piece of understanding. The energy release during that reaction comes out in laughter. - p. 41</span>
            <span class="c1">To gain respect and succeed in this art form, play to the height of your intelligence. You can play an idiot or a retard, but strive to play the smartest retard that you possibly can. - p. 41</span>
            <span class="c1">The key to teaching new students or students that have been taught incorrectly is to remain composed. Hostility and impatience only serve to stunt their growth. We have to realize that our mission today is not to erect the pyramid but to set up a solid foundation so that the construction can be completed effortlessly after we depart. - p. 183</span>
            <span class="c1">My friends, you are all under the misconception that you are the most important person on the stage. You are not. Your scene partner is. You need to consciously invest more concern and respect for each other on stage. Humility and deference will take you farther than arrogance and selfishness. - p. 186</span>
            <span class="c1">Start every scene in the middle. - p. 247</span>
            <span class="c1">Don’t ever think this journey is about you. It’s about everyone around you. - p. 262</span>

            <span class="c2">In 1997 my eyes were opened to a whole new realm when I met Zhu Xilin, a T’ai Chi master from China who introduced me to the concept of moving from one’s center and letting the arms and legs follow. - p. 7</span>
            <span class="c2">Then he says, “Just set up your body correctly, and let the chi move through it. Let your mind do the work...let your body relax. Don’t let muscles do it. Let chi do it.” - p. 23</span>
            <span class="c2">Chi is also known as life force. It generates movement in the physical world, and it animates life. It is also energy that is created by movement, so it is bother the product and the tool. It is the life-giving energy that unites body, mind, and spirit. An invisible and unmeasurable force that can be seen only by its effect, it is much like air, which can be seen only when it blows through the leaves of a tree or inflates a balloon. - p. 23</span>
            <span class="c2">Your job is to learn to set up the optimal conditions for chi to move through your body, and voilá...running happens! - p. 23</span>
            <span class="c2">“It is impossible for us to break the law ourselves. We can only break ourselves against the law.” - Cecil B. DeMille p. 31</span>
            <span class="c2">The Key Principles:
            Cotton and Steel: Gather to your center
            Gradual Progress: The step by step approach
            The Pyramid: The small is supported by the large
            Balance in Motion: Equal balance and complementary balance
            Nonidentification: Getting yourself out of the way - p. 32</span>
            <span class="c2">According to T’ai Chi, your center, or dan tien, is located just below your navel and in front of your spine. It is conveniently hooked up to your arms and legs by a series of bones, ligaments, and tendons, so whenever you move your center, your arms and legs move too. But in order for your center to do its work efficiently, the rest of your body has to relax and offer no resistance to the movement. - p. 33</span>
            <span class="c2">Here are a few examples of how balance can manifest itself:
            Balance of fluids: The more you sweat, the more you need to drink.
            Balance of workouts: Alternate easy and hard workouts.
            Balance of fuel: The harder you work, the more fuel you require.
            Balance of effort: The faster you run, the more you need to relax your legs.
            Balance of work and play: The harder you work, the more important it is that you play. - p. 40</span>
            <span class="c2">Relaxation is the absence of unnecessary effort. - p. 55</span>
            <span class="c2">It seems so much easier to do anything when you offer no resistance to doing it, especially when it’s something that you don’t like to do! - p. 56</span>
            <span class="c2">True relaxation comes from possessing a strong center and letting go of all else. - p. 57</span>
            <span class="c2">Focusing. Body Sensing. Breathing. Relaxing. - p. 57</span>
            <span class="c2">Here are the three steps to setting up your Column:
            Upper Body Alignment: Straighten your upper body with your hands.
            Lower Body Alignment: Look for your shoelaces and make any necessary adjustments to your hips.
            Pelvic Alignment: Lift your pelvis up in front, using your lower abs, not your glutes. - p. 70</span>
            <span class="c2">When you stand upright, gravity is pulling straight down on your body along your centerline. As soon as you allow your body to fall forward, your center of gravity moves in front of your point of contact with the ground. This engages gravity to pull you in more of a horizontal forward direction. - p. 71</span>
            <span class="c2">By tilting your body forward from your feet (not from your waist), you place your center of gravity ahead of your foot strike. Any physicist will tell you that when that occurs, you are no longer braking, because your feet are moving toward the rear when they strike the ground. This changes your foot strike to the midfoot and allows your legs to extend as your feet leave the ground, radically reducing the amount of impact on your knees and quads. - p. 72</span>
            <span class="c2">Lower Body Form Focuses:
            Pick Up Your Feet
            Limp Lower Legs
            Swing Your Legs To The Rear
            Loosen Your Hips
            Cadence
            Gears And Stride Length - p. 76</span>
            <span class="c2">Stride length is to running as gears are to a bicycle. - p. 81</span>
            <span class="c2">Gears and Cadence in a Nutshell:
            Slower speed = less lean = short stride = lower gear
            Higher speed = more lean = longer stride = higher gear
            Tempo always stays at 85 to 90 rpm
            As you lean forward, your stride length opens up out the back - p. 82</span>
            <span class="c2">A spiritual teacher once told me that if you want to establish new habits, you should repeat the desired habit every day for forty days, and it will become ingrained in your consciousness. - p. 126</span>
            <span class="c2">Let your goals be an expression of who you are, not something that will impress someone or earn praise. - p. 135</span>
            <span class="c2">The three focuses I recommend starting with are:
            1) Holding your posture straight
            2) Leaning from your feet
            3) Picking up your feet as you run - p. 140</span>
            <span class="c2">That’s what growth is all about. It doesn’t come when things are status quo. It happens only when something new is introduced, forcing every integral part to adjust. This is a universal law that can be applied on any level of life, whether it’s expanding a business or helping a shy person become a better public speaker. - p. 148</span>
            <span class="c2">I don’t want to imply just because you’re in a state of imbalance that you’re growing, but the possibility of growth is there. Too many people live most of their lives in an unbalanced state and never get anywhere. - p. 149</span>
            <span class="c2">General Guidelines for Upgrading a Running Program
            - Don’t make more than two upgrades of any kind per week.
            - Don’t add more than 15 to 30 seconds on to an interval.
            - Don’t add more than 15 minutes (or 10% additional mileage) to a long run each week.
            - If you increase the number of intervals, run the earlier ones slightly slower.
            - If you increase the speed at which you run your intervals, decrease the total number, then slowly build the number weekly while maintaining your new speed.
            - If you happen to have a good run when you unexpectedly run faster or farther than usual, don’t follow it with any scheduled upgrades. Postpone them until the following week. - p. 150</span>
            <span class="c2">Productive discomfort is a necessary part of any growth process...Another phrase used to describe productive discomfort was coined by the Russian mystic G.I. Gurdjieff, who called it “intentional suffering,” which pretty much tells it like it is. - p. 156</span>
            <span class="c2">Focuses to Remember When You’re Feeling Tired
            - Shorten your stride.
            - Correct your posture. Make sure your feet are hitting behind your upper body, not in front of it.
            - Engage your lean again, but don’t bend at the waist.
            - Slow down your pace until you recover some strength.
            - Breathe more from your abdomen and increase your breath rate. Some people get tired from breathing too slowly.
            - Look up and take in the world around you. Don’t focus on your fatigue, or you’ll get more tired. Look around and take in energy from the scenery.
            - Relax your shoulders. Let your arms at your sides for 30 seconds every two miles.
            - Pick up your heels and get your feet moving in a circular motion. Stay away from a shuffle.
            - Try to relax any muscles that feel particularly tired or sore. This will help keep energy flowing to overworked areas. - p. 184</span>
            <span class="c2">Your technique: Have a good working knowledge of the ChiRunning focuses and how to apply them. Constantly work to perfect your technique, especially in the areas where you feel the weakest.
            Your training: Develop and plan a personally tailored program: daily, weekly, monthly. Have a good attitude about your program and exhibit perseverance with your training. Know what you need to do to get yourself from where you’re starting to the day of your race in the best possible condition, physically and mentally.
            Your event: Have a clear logistical plan of what you intend to do on race day, along with a strategy for using everything that you have been practicing. - p. 194</span>
            <span class="c2">Drive the course...or better yet, run it. Then make notes of what the course is like, mile by mile. - p. 196</span>
            <span class="c2">Training diet: Always eat a good protein meal (meat, fish, poultry, tofu) after a strenuous workout. It helps your body build muscle tissue. Eat a carbohydrate meal (whole-wheat bread, whole grains, whole-wheat pasta, and starchy vegetables) the night before any workout you consider physically challenging. Likewise, try to avoid the heavier protein meals before a hard workout.
            Pre-race diet: Days 6, 5, 4 before the race, eat protein for breakfast and dinner (soy products, meat, fish, or beans and rice). Days 3, 2, 1 before the race, eat only carbohydrates (no protein), like whole-wheat pasta, whole grains, and veggies.
            Race day: Eat foods that digest quickly, providing blood sugar. Eat lightly—bananas, toast and honey, fruits, dates or raisins—and don’t eat anything you’re not used to.
            Post-race diet: A good protein meal (meat, fish, poultry, tofu) after a race helps your body rebuild muscle tissue. It’s also important to replace minerals by eating leafy green salads and vegetables soon after the race. - p. 199</span>
            <span class="c2">The wisdom of life consists in the elimination of non-essentials. - Lin Yu-Tang - p. 204</span>
            <span class="c2">Cotton and Steel. Gather to your center and let go of all else. - p. 206</span>
            <span class="c2">The freedom to not be intimidated by challenges I face. The freedom to follow my intuition instead of second-guessing my choices. The freedom to allow my present condition to guide my future but not rule it. - p. 218</span>
            <span class="c2">Any day that you don’t finish a run is still a day that you went out for a beautiful run. If that’s the downside, then there’s no downside! - p. 221</span>
            <span class="c2">It’s about doing the necessary work of maintaining and carefully building your base so that growth—albeit slow sometimes—is always in a forward direction. When you feel centered in yourself, with the confidence that years of mindful living produce, you are freed up to live your life creatively while keeping to your practice. - p. 222</span>

            <span class="c3">Lord Asriel was a tall man with powerful shoulders, a fierce dark face, and eyes that seemed to flash and glitter with savage laughter. It was a face to be dominated by, or to fight: never a face to patronize or pity. All his movements were large and perfectly balanced, like those of a wild animal, and when he appeared in a room like this, he seemed a wild animal held in a cage too small for it. - p. 13</span>
            <span class="c3">...and he would sit back with one ankle resting on the other knee and watch her inscrutably until her words failed. - p. 37</span>
            <span class="c3">Like a wave that has been building its strength over a thousand miles of ocean, and which makes little stir in the deep water, but which when it reaches the shallows rears itself up high into the sky, terrifying the shore dwellers, before crashing down on the land with irresistible power–so Iorek Gyrnison rose up against Iofur, exploding upward from his firm footing on the dry rock and slashing with a ferocious left hand at the exposed jaw of Iofur Raknison. - p. 353</span>
            <span class="c3">...But I can do it. Somewhere out there is the origin of all the Dust, all the death, the sin, the misery, the destructiveness in the world. Human beings can’t see anything without wanting to destroy it, Lyra. That’s original sin. And I’m going to destroy it. Death is going to die. - p. 377</span>
            <span class="c3">So Lyra and her daemon turned away from the world they were born in, and looked toward the sun, and walked into the sky. - p. 399</span>

            <span class="c5">He made himself quiet and dull-eyed and slow, and in under a minute he bacame less interesting, less attractive to human attention. The people simply became bored with this dull child, and forgot him and turned away. - p. 108</span>
            <span class="c5">Instead of seeing only the wickedness and cruelty and greed of the ghosts that come down here, from now on you will have the right to ask all the ghosts to tell you the stories of their lives, and they will have to tell the truth about what they’ve seen and touched and heard and loved and known in the world. Every one of these ghosts has a story; every single one that comes down in the future will have true things to tell you about the world. And you’ll have the right to hear them, and they will have to tell you. - p. 317</span>

            <span class="c5">And at half past nine in the evening at that restaurant table in Portugal, someone gave me a piece of marzipan and it all came back. And I thought: am I really going to spend the rest of my life without ever feeling that again? I thought: I want to go to China. It’s full of treasure and strangeness and mystery and joy. I thought, will anyone be better off if I go straight back to the hotel and say my prayers and confess to the priest and promise never to fall into temptation again? Will anyone be the better for making me miserable? And the answer came back—no. No one will. There’s no one to fret, no one to condemn, no one to bless me for being a good girl, no one to punish me for being wicked. Heaven was empty. I didn’t know whether God had died, or whether there never had been a God at all. Either way I felt free and lonely and I didn’t know whether I was happy or unhappy, but something very strange had happened. And all that huge change came about as I had the marzipan in my mouth, before I’d even swallowed it. A taste—a memory—a landslide. - p. 445</span>
            <span class="c5">I came to believe that good and evil are names for what people do, not for what they are. All we can say is that this is a good deed, because it helps someone, or that’s an evil one, because it hurts them. People are too complicated to have simple labels. - p. 447</span>

            <span class="c6">Love makes us who we are, and who we can become. - p. viii</span>
            <span class="c6">Every book, if it is anything at all, is an argument. - p. viii</span>
            <span class="c6">People who do not intuit or respect the laws of acceleration and momentum break bones; those who do not grasp the principles of love waste their lives and break their hearts. - p. 13</span>
            <span class="c6">The questions we ask change the world we see. - p. 18</span>
            <span class="c6">Those who wish to drink in the details, however, need not drown in them. - p. 18</span>
            <span class="c6">The rapid demise of the reptilian giants left open opportunities for an upwardly mobile class. Mammals scurried into the gap and bred like the rabbits they were to become. Sixty-five million years later, the Age of Mammals is still in full swing. - p. 24</span>
            <span class="c6">As E.E. Cummings observed: Always a more beautiful answer that asks a more beautiful question. - p. 29</span>
            <span class="c6">Evolution is a kaleidoscope, not a pyramid: the shapes and variety of species are constantly shifting, but there is no basis for assigning supremacy, no pinnacle toward which the system is moving. Five hundred million years ago, every species was either adapted to that world or changing to become so. The same is true today. We are free to label ourselves the end product of evolution not because it is so, but because we exist now. Expunge this temperocentrist bias, and the neocortical brain is not the most advanced of the three, but simply the most recent. - p. 31</span>
            <span class="c6">But in the words of a neocortical brain as mighty as Einstein’s: “We should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality. It cannot lead; it can only serve.” - p. 32</span>
            <span class="c6">A mood is a state of enhanced readiness to experience a certain emotion. Where an emotion is a single note, clearly struck, hanging for a moment in the still air, a mood is the extended, nearly inaudible echo that follows. - p. 44</span>
            <span class="c6">The most common precipitant of this reiterant emotionality is cognition: people tend to think about emotionally arousing occasions afterward, recirculating the experience and stimulating the consequent emotion just as if the inciting event had actually re-occurred. The human penchant for this post hoc cogitation can magnify the physiologic impact of an emotion many times. - p. 45</span>
            <span class="c6">“Dream delivers us to dream, and there is no end to illusion. Life is a train of moods like a string of beads, and, as we pass through them, they prove to be many-colored lenses which paint the world their own hue...Temperament is the iron wire on which the beads are strung.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson, p. 47</span>
            <span class="c6">Short separations provoke an acute response known as protest, while prolonged separations yield the physiologic state of despair. - p. 76</span>
            <span class="c6">The mammalian nervous system depends for its neurophysiologic stability on a system of interactive coordination, wherein steadiness comes from synchronization with nearby attachment figures...Evolution has given mammals a shimmering conduit, and they use it to tinker with one another’s physiology, to adjust and fortify one another’s fragile neural rhythms in the collaborative dance of love. We call this mutually synchronizing exchange limbic regulation - p. 84</span>
            <span class="c6">The reciprocal process occurs simultaneously: the first person regulates the physiology of the second, even as he himself is regulated. Neither is a functioning whole on his own; each has open loops that only somebody else can complete. Together they create a stable, properly balanced pair of organisms. - p. 85</span>
            <span class="c6">That open-loop design means that in some important ways, people cannot be stable on their own – not should or shouldn’t be, but can’t be...Stability means finding people who regulate ou well and staying near them. - p. 86</span>
            <span class="c6">Full-grown, these monkeys are living proof of limbic regulation’s enduring power: they are timid, clingy, subordinate, and clumsy in their efforts to establish ties to other monkeys. The brains of these animals evidence permanent alterations in neurochemistry...With their vulnerability to anxiety and depression, their social awkwardness and failures to attach as adults, these monkeys exhibit a close animal counterpart to the multifaceted misery that in human beings is labeled neurotic. - p. 90</span>
            <span class="c6">As a society, if we do not attend to the limbic needs of our own young, we risk creating an epidemic of loss vulnerability. - p. 93</span>
            <span class="c6">We are attached to keep our brains on track, in a process that begins before birth and sustains life until its end. The earliest portion of that duet must catch our attention: attachment changes a young mammal forever, as limbic regulation carves enduring patterns of knowledge into the developing circuits of the mind. - p. 99</span>
            <span class="c6">Since time’s beginning, romantic partners have searched for each other with exquisite but obscure deliberation...Not just anyone will do; in fact, to any one person looking for a mate, almost nobody will. - p. 101</span>
            <span class="c6">Implicit memory ensures that camouflaged learning permeates our lives...Behind the familiar bright, analytic engine of consciousness is a shadow of silent strength, spinning dazzlingly complicated life into automatic actions, convictions without intellect, and hunches whose reasons follow later or not at all. It is this darker system that guides our choices in love. - p. 112</span>
            <span class="c6">We play out our unconscious knowledge in every unthinking move we make in the dance of loving. If a child has the right parents, he learns the right principles – that love means protection, caretaking, loyalty, sacrifice. He comes to know it not because he is told, but because his brain automatically narrows crowded confusion into a few regular prototypes. If he has emotionally unhealthy parents, a child unwittingly memorizes the precise lesson of their troubled relationship: that love is suffocation, that anger is terrifying, that dependence is humiliating, or one of a million other crippling variations. - p. 116</span>
            <span class="c6">Experience methodically rewires the brain, and the nature of what is has seen dictates what it can see. - p. 135</span>
            <span class="c6">A network then registers novel sensory information as if it conformed to past experience. In much the same way, our sun’s blinding glare washes countless dimmer stars from the midday sky. - p. 138</span>
            <span class="c6">The more often you do or think or imagine  thing, the more probable it is that your mind will revisit its prior stopping point. When the circuits are sufficiently well worn such that thoughts fly down them with little friction or resistance, that mental path has become a part of you – it is now a habit of speech, thought, action, attitude. Ongoing exposure to one person’s Attractors does not merely activate neural patterns in another – it also strengthens them. Long-standing togetherness writes permanent changes into a brain’s open book.
            In a relationship, one mind revises another; one heart changes its partner. This astounding legacy of our combined status as mammals and neural beings is limbic revision: the power to remodel the emotional parts of the people we love, as our Attractors activate certain limbic pathways, and the brain’s inexorable memory mechanism reinforces them.
            Who we are and who we become depends, in part, on whom we love. - p. 143</span>
            <span class="c6">Everything a person is and everything he knows resides in the tangled thicket of his intertwined neurons. These fateful, tiny bridges number in the quadrillions, but they spring from just two sources: DNA and daily life. The genetic code calls some synapses into being, while experience engenders and modifies others. - p. 148</span>
            <span class="c6">DNA is not the heart’s destiny; the genetic lottery may determine the cards in your deck, but experience deals the hand you can play. - p. 153</span>
            <span class="c6">Emotional experience begins as a derivative; a child gets his first taste of his feelings secondhand. Only through limbic resonance with another can he begin to apprehend his inner world. The first few years of resonance prepare this instrument for a lifetime’s use. - p. 156</span>
            <span class="c6">That concentrated knowledge whispers to a child from beneath the veil of consciousness, telling him what relationships are, how they function, what to anticipate, how to conduct them. If a parent loves him in the healthiest way, wherein his needs are paramount, mistakes are forgiven, patience is plentiful, and hurts are soothed as they can be, then that is how he will relate to himself and others. - p. 160</span>
            <span class="c6">The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes. - Marcel Proust, p. 165</span>
            <span class="c6">Every person broadcasts information about his inner world. As a collection of dense matter betrays its presence through electromagnetic emissions, a person’s emotional Attractors manifest themselves in a radiant aura of limbic tones. If a listener quiets his neocortical chatter and allows limbic sensing to range free, melodies begin to penetrate the static of anonymity. Inspanidual tales of reactions, hopes, expectations, and dreams resolve into themes. Stories about lovers, teachers, friends, and pets echo back and forth and coalesce into a handful of motifs. As the listener’s resonance grows, he will catch sight of what the other sees inside that personal world, start to sense what it feels like to live there. - p. 169</span>
            <span class="c6">Psychotherapy changes people because one mammal can restructure the limbic brain of another...When a limbic connection has established a neural pattern, it takes a limbic connection to revise it. - p. 177</span>

            <span class="c6">The emotional fate of children is inextricably bound to the ability of their parents to love one another – a skill that is falling into disrepair. - p. 204</span>
            <span class="c6">Relationships live on time. They devour it in the way that bees feed on pollen or aerobic cells on oxygen: with an unbending singularity of purpose and possibility of compromise or substitution. - p. 205</span>
            <span class="c6">If two people who love each other let a single instant wedge itself between them, it grows – it becomes a month, a year, a century; it becomes too late. - Jean Giraudoux, p. 205</span>
            <span class="c6">If somebody must jettison a part of life, time with a mate should be last on the list: he needs that connection to live. - p. 206</span>
            <span class="c6">All the waking moments of our love lives should tend, we are told, toward that throbbing, amorous apotheosis. But in love merely brings the players together, and the end of that prelude is as inevitable as it is desirable. True relatedness has a chance to blossom only with the waning of its intoxicating predecessor. - p. 207</span>
            <span class="c6">Loving derives from intimacy, the prolonged and detailed surveillance of a foreign soul. - p. 207</span>
            <span class="c6">Lovers hold keys to each other’s identities, and they write neurostructural alterations into each other’s networks. Their limbic tie allows each to influence who the other is and becomes. - p. 208</span>
            <span class="c6">The prevailing myth reaching most contemporary ears is this: relationships are 50-50...Love is simultaneous mutual regulation, wherein each person meets the needs of the other, because neither can provide for his own. Such a relationship is not 50-50 – it’s 100-100. - p. 208</span>
            <span class="c6">Because relationships are mutual, partners share a single fate: no action benefits one and harms the other. The hard bargainer, who thinks he can win by convincing his partner to meet his needs while circumventing hers, is doomed. - p. 208</span>
            <span class="c6">Happiness is within range only for adroit people who give the slip to America’s values. These rebels will necessarily forgo exalted titles, glamorous friends, exotic vacations, washboard abs, designer everything – all the proud indicators of upward mobility – and in exchange, they may just get a chance at a decent life. - p. 209</span>
            <span class="c6">Close early relationships instill a permanent resilience to the degenerative influence of stress, while neglect sensitizes children to those effects. - p. 211</span>
            <span class="c6">When you love, you wish to do things for. You wish to sacrifice for. You wish to serve. - Ernest Hemingway, p. 215</span>
            <span class="c6">Modern man is estranged from being, from his own being, from the being of other creatures in the world, from transcendent being. He has lost something – what, he does not know; he only knows that he is sick unto death with the loss of it. - Walker Percy, p. 224</span>
            <span class="c6">In pursuit of further riches, the information age demands a more throughgoing surrender – less time for relationships, less time for children, more time for impersonal everything. Before our lives wither away into dust, we might ponder how much more prosperity human beings can possibly survive. - p. 225</span>
            <span class="c6">The consequences that flow from limbic ignorance are as grim as love’s victories are miraculous. The tragedy lies, as all tragedy does, in the knowledge that these sad outcomes once held the potential for greatness. - p. 225</span>
            <span class="c6">Limbic resonance, regulation, and revision define our emotional existence; they are the walls and towers of the neural edifice evolution has built for mammals to live in. Our intellect is largely blind to them. - p. 229</span>

When you’re nine, you think you’ve always been nine years old and will always be. When you’re thirty, it seems you’ve always been balanced there on that bright rim of middle life. And then when you turn seventy, you are always and forever seventy. You’re in the present, you’re trapped in a young now or an old now, but there is no other now to be seen. - p. 82</span>

            <span class="c7">I’ve always known that the quality of love was the mind, even though the body sometimes refuses this knowledge. The body lives for itself. It lives only to feed and wait for the night. It’s essentially nocturnal. But what of the mind which is born of the sun, William, and must spend thousands of hours of a lifetime awake and aware? Can you balance off the body, that pitiful, selfish thing of night against a whole lifetime of sun and intellect? I don’t know. I only know there has been your mind here and my mind here, and the afternoons have been like none I can remember. There is still so much to talk about, but we must save it for another time.” - p. 167</span>

            <span class="c7">Douglas’s mouth was slightly open and from his lips and from the thin vents of his nostrils, gently there rose a scent of cool night and cool water and cool white snow and cool green moss, and cool moonlight on silver pebbles liying at the bottom of a quiet river and cool clear water at the bottom of a small white stone well.
            It was like holding their heads down for a brief moment to the pulse of an apple-scented fountain flowing cool up into the air and washing their faces.

            <span class="c8">Whether it is good or evil, whether life in itself is pain or pleasure, whether it is uncertain–that it may perhaps be this is not important–but the unity of the world, the coherence of all events, the embracing of the big and the small from the same stream, from the same law of cause, of becoming and dying: this shines clearly from your exalted teachings. - p. 26</span>
            <span class="c8">...when you throw a stone into the water, it finds the quickest way to the bottom of the water. It is the same when Siddhartha has an aim, a goal. Siddhartha does nothing; he waits, he thinks, he fasts, but he goes through the affairs of the world like the stone through the water, without doing anything, without bestirring himself; he is drawn by his goal, for he does not allow anything to enter his mind which opposes his goal. That is what Siddhartha learned from the Samanas. It is what fools call magic and what they think is caused by demons. Nothing is caused by demons; there are no demons. Everyone can perform magic, everyone can reach his goal, if he can think, wait, and fast. - p. 50</span>

            <span class="c8">He learned from [the river] continually. Above all, he learned from it how to listen, to listen with a still heart, with a waiting, open soul, without passion, without desire, without judgment, without opinions. - p. 87</span>

            <span class="c8">But stronger than his knowledge was his love for [his son], his devotion, his fear of losing him. had he ever lost his heart to anybody so completely, had he ever loved anybody so much, so blindly, so painfully, so hopelessly and yet so happily? - p. 99</span>
            <span class="c8">Their vanities, desires and trivialities no longer seemed absurd to him; they had become understandable, lovable, and even worthy of respect. There was the blind love of a mother for her child, the blind foolish pride of a fond father for his only son, the blind eager strivings of a young vain woman for ornament and the admiration of men. All these little simple, foolish, but tremendously strong, vital, passionate urges and desires no longer seemed trivial to Siddhartha. For their sake he saw people live and do great things, travel, conduct wars, suffer and endure immensely, and he loved them for it. He saw life, vitality, the indestructible and Brahman in all their desires and needs. These people were worthy of love and admiration in their blind loyalty, in the blind strength and tenacity. - p. 106</span>
            <span class="c8">The men of the world were equal to the thinkers in everyother respect and were often surperior to them, just as animals in their tenacious undeviating actions in cases of necessity may often seem superior to human beings. - p. 106</span>
            <span class="c8">Within Siddhartha there slowly grew and ripened he knowledge of what wisdom really was and the goal of his long seeking. It was nothing but a preparation of the soul, a capacity, a secret art of thinking, feeling, and breathing thoughts of unity at every moment of life. - p. 106</span>

This is where the world’s brightest young talents come to braise carmelized racks of corn-fed songbirds or offer up their famous knuckle of flash-seared crappie served with a collar of chided ginger and cornered by a tribe of kiln-roasted Chilean toadstools, teased with a warm spray of clarified musk oil. Even when they promise something simple, they’ve got to tart it up – the meatloaf has been poached in seawater, or there are figs in the tuna salad. If cooking is an art, I think we’re in our Dada phase. - p. 122</span>

            <span class="c1">“If he wants to work on himself, he must destroy his peace. To have them both is in no way possible. A man must make a choice. But when choosing the result is very often deceit, that is to say, a man tries to deceive himself. In words he chooses work but in reality he not want to lose his peace. Such submission is the most difficult thing there can be for a man who thinks that he is capable of deciding anything.” - Ouspensky p. 2</span>
            <span class="c1">“It is time now for us to rise from sleep.” - St. Benedict p. 3</span>
            <span class="c1">“Far within me, where the memory of what I am is still unclouded, a little child is waking up and making an old man’s mask weep. A little child looking for mother and father, looking with you for protection and help–protection from his pleasures and his dreams, and help in order to become what he is without imitating anyone.” - Daumal p. 3</span>
            <span class="c1">“If a man gives way to all his desires, or panders to them, there will be no inner struggle in him, no friction, no fire. But if, for the sake of attaining a definite aim, he struggles with the desires that hinder him, he will then create a fire which will gradually transform his inner world into a single whole.” - Ouspensky p. 11</span>
            <span class="c1">“Another thing that people must sacrifice is their suffering. No one who has not sacrificed his suffering can work. Nothing can be attained without suffering but at the same time one must begin by sacrificing suffering.” - Ouspensky p. 11</span>
            <span class="c1">“And even in his corrections, let him act with prudence, and not go too far, lest while he seeketh too eagerly to scrape off the rust, the vessel be broken.” - Rule for the Abbot p. 11</span>
            <span class="c1">A note of caution, however. Teachers of hatha yoga who teach only hatha yoga often mistake the shadow for the substance. Although they may be able to point out correct postures and procedures, many of these teachers do not themselves comprehend the implications of the term yoga . . . that is, they are not doing asanas as a means of union the with One. A student who works with such teachers runs the risk of profaning the undertaking in the very beginning by developing a poor mental set towards this work. With this caution in mind, however, it is possible for you, if you understand the reasons (especially the one concerning the use of body positions as a form of prayer) for doing asanas, to learn specific methodology from a teacher who himself does not understand these reasons. - p. 24</span>
            <span class="c1">Your state of mind is of paramount importance in asanas. Don’t identify with the ego who is doing the asanas. Merely watch the body move into the appropriate position. Stay in a place inside yourself where nothing is happening at all. - p. 24</span>

Merely redefine the situation in terms of the fourth chakra . . . in terms of compassionate love for all beings. - p. 42</span>

            <span class="c1">“Love has to spring spontaneously from within: and it is in no way amenable to any form of inner or outer force. Love and coercion can never go together: but though love cannot be forced on anyone, it an be awakened in him through love itself. Love is essentially self-communicative: Those who do not have it catch it from those who have it. True love is unconquerable and irresistible; and it goes on gathering power and spreading itself, until eventually it transforms everyone whom it touches. - Ramakrishna p. 73</span>
            <span class="c1">“For when you say “I fell in love” with him or her you are saying that he or she was the key that unlocked your heart–the place within yourself where you are love.” - Ramakrishna p. 73</span>

            <span class="c1">b) Get into a comfortable seat. It should be a position you can remain in for at least thirty minutes without moving or discomfort. It is desirable that the head, neck, and chest be in a straight line.
            c) At first let your mind wander and just watch it. Just note how your mind works. Don’t think about the thoughts. Just note them. Do this for about thirty minutes a day for a week.
            d) Then find a muscle in your abdomen, just below your rib cage, which moves when you breathe such that it (the muscle) rises and falls. Attend to it. Every time the muscle rises, think “Rising,” and every time it falls, think “Falling” . . . rising . . . falling . . . rising . . . falling. Let all other thoughts drift by and keep your attention focused on this muscle. Don’t lose heart. At first the mind will wander frequently. Each time it does, follow it immediately upon becoming conscious of its wandering. Note where it wandered to, and then immediately  return to rising . . . falling . . . rising . . . falling . . .
            ...All other thoughts don’t belong here. Don’t try to suppress them (for that is just another thought). Rather, not the intruding thought, give it a label, and return to the task at hand. After about a month you will note a great calm and sense of peace from this exercise.
            e) After you get in the habit of merely noting each stimuli in the Here and Now without thinking aou it, then add additional steps designed to further free you from illusion. Specifically, you add Clear Comprehension. This advanced practice involves describing the noted thought or state in terms of its purpose, its suitability, the way in which it relates to spiritual practice, and finally in terms of its total impersonality. These descriptions (which are described in detail in a number of books on Buddhist meditation) are ritualistic in nature and help you to see the impermanence of thought, the way in which it perpetuates suffering, and the fact that it does not in any way imply the presence of an ego or “I” who thinks it.
            Great gains in meditative practice may be made without these advanced stages. The simple technique of bare attention is very powerful. With the advanced techniques available in Buddhist texts you develop in time a totally dispassionate view of the thoughts which fill your consciousness. - p. 82</span>

            <span class="c1">Imagine that you have died: Your body is passive, lifeless, useless. Your body is discarded. Your funeral is about to take place.
            Let go of your body. Let it be there as something which is no longer yours. Follow to the limit this feeling of being completely alone, abandoned, not loved–not in life, not in death. Cry, scream, curse, if this is what you feel. Go to the limit of your feeling. And after you have cried and screamed and cursed, when you are empty and exhausted, stop and listen.
            This is your last party. Speak to everyone there, tell them all about yourself, about your mistakes and your suffering, about your love and your longings. No longer do you need to protect yourself, no longer do you need to hide behind a wall or a suit of armor. It is your last party: you can explode, you can be miserable or pitiful, insignificant or despicable. At your funeral you can be yourself.
            This is your chance: do what others have failed to do. - p. 114</span>

Maybe their Riders will drag the Elephant down the road for a while, but as we’ve seen, that effort can’t last long. Once you break through to the feeling, though, things change. - p. 14</span>
            <span class="c2">What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity. - p. 15</span>
            <span class="c2">Direct The Rider. What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity. So provide crystal-clear direction (think 1% milk).
            Motivate The Elephant. What looks like laziness is often exhaustion. The Rider can’t get his way by force for very long. So it’s critical that you engage people’s emotional side (think of the cookies and radishes study and the boardroom conference table full of gloves).
            Shape The Path. What looks like a people problem is often a situation problem. We call the situation (including the surrounding environment) the “Path.” When you shape the Path, you make change more likely, no matter what’s happening with the Rider and Elephant (think of the effect of shrinking movie popcorn buckets). - p. 17</span>

            <span class="c2">When the Rider sees that things are going well, he doesn’t think much about them. But when things break, he snaps to attention and starts applying his problem-solving skills. So when your kids are making A’s and B’s, you don’t think much about their grades.

We establish a clear set of goals that are within immediate reach: we’re going to be a smart team; we’re going to be a well-conditioned team; we’re going to be a team that plays hard; we’re going to be a team that has pride; we’re going to be a team that wants to win collectively; we’re going to be a team that doesn’t criticize one another.
            When we start acting in ways that fulfill these goals, I make sure everybody knows it. I accentuate the positive at every possible opportunity, and at the same time I emphasize the next goal that we need to fulfill. If we have a particularly good practice, then I call the team together and say, ‘We got something done today; we executed well. I’m very pleased with your work. But here’s what I want to do tomorrow; I want to see flawless special teams work. If you accomplish that, we will be ready for the game on Sunday.’
            When you set small, visible goals, and people achieve them, they start to get it into their heads that they can succeed. They break the habit of losing and begin to get into the habit of winning.” - Bill Parcells, p. 143</span>

Names are small and sinister metaphors which restrict, absolutely, the use of an object. Our eyes open to this madness every morning, and at night we dream within the dream; whole lives are spent without as much as a ripple of doubt on its surface. But when the object is allowed to shrug off its name, it begins the long road back to its mystery  – and on finally reaching the core of its own estranging fire, radiates until the whole world is unified by it.

            <span class="c6">But time...how time first grounds us and then confounds us. We thought we were being mature when we were only being safe. We imagined we were being responsible but were only being cowardly. What we called realism turned out to be a way of avoiding things rather than facing them. Time...give us enough time and our best-supported decisions will seem wobbly, our certainties whimsical. - p. 102</span>

            <span class="c7">My definition of leadership is simple: it's the act of making something happen which otherwise would not have happened.  Mine is an action-oriented definition: if you act and make a difference, you are leading.  Hopefully that difference is a positive one.  If you know the right thing to do, or the right framework to use, you are part of the way there, but you are not leading (yet).  You must act.  It's the only to make a difference. A key implication from the example of Mo Cheeks is that acting as a leader demands that we embrace our own mediocrity. "Am I willing to risk my personal reputation and status for the good of others?" becomes a fundamental question any potential leader must answer.  We must balance the inferior nature of our solution and abilities against what the state of the world would be if we did not act.</span>

            1) You must clearly display the trappings, postures, and gestures of dominance.
            2) In moments of active rivalry you must threaten your subordinates aggressively.
            3) In moments of physical challenge you (or your delegates) must be able forcibly to overpower your subordinates.
            4) If a challenge involves brain rather than brawn you must be able to outwit your subordinates.
            5) You must suppress squabbles that break out between your subordinates.
            6) You must reward your immediate subordinates by permitting them to enjoy the benefits of their high ranks.
            7) You must protect the weaker members of the group from undue persecution.
            8) You must make decisions concerning the social activities of your group.
            9) You must reassure your extreme subordinates from time to time.
            10) You must take the initiative in repelling threats or attacks arising from outside your group. - p. 69</span>

            <span class="c8">The stages I try to take students through involve the realization 1) that we struggle against our own imaginations, especially when we try to be imaginative; 2) that we are not responsible for the content of our imaginations; and 3) that we are not, as we are taught to think, our “personalities”, but that the imagination is our true self. - p. 105</span>

            <span class="c9">Dictators require the assistance of the people they rule, without which they cannot secure and maintain the sources of political power. - p. 18</span>
            <span class="c9">Isolated inspaniduals, not members of such groups, usually are unable to make a significant impact on the rest of the society, much less a government, and certainly not a dictatorship. - p. 22</span>

            <span class="c9">However, types of struggle that target the dictatorship’s identifiable weaknesses have greater chance of success than those that seek to fight the dictatorship where it is clearly strongest. The question is how this struggle is to be waged. - p. 28</span>

            <span class="c9">These methods [of nonviolent action] are classified under three broad categories: protest and persuasion, noncooperation, and intervention. - p. 31</span>
            <span class="c9">Nonviolent discipline is a key to success and must be maintained despite provocations and brutalities by the dictators and their agents. - p. 32</span>
            <span class="c9">In this process the stark brutality of the regime against the clearly nonviolent actionists politically rebounds against the dictator’s position, causing dissension in their own ranks as well as fomenting support for the resisters among the general population, the regime’s usual supporters, and third parties. - p. 33</span>
            <span class="c9">That abandonment or control of fear is a key element in destroying the power of the dictators over the general population. - p. 33</span>
            <span class="c9">Secrecy, deception, and underground conspiracy pose very difficult problems for a movement using nonviolent action. - p. 33</span>
            <span class="c9">From the perspective of the movement, secrecy is not only rooted in fear but contributes to fear, which dampens the spirit  of resistance and reduces the number of people who can participate in a given action. It also can contribute to suspicions and accusations, often unjustified, within the movement, concerning who is an informer or agent of the opponents. - p. 33</span>
            <span class="c9">In contrast, openness regarding intentions and plans will not only have the opposite effects, but will contribute to an image that the resistance movement is in fact extremely powerful. - p. 34</span>
            <span class="c9">The maintenance of high standards of behavior in nonviolent action is necessary at all stages of the conflict. Such factors as fearlessness and maintaining nonviolent discipline are always required. p. 34</span>
            <span class="c9">However, such numbers can be obtained as reliable participants only by maintaining the high standards of the movement. - p. 34</span>
            <span class="c9">Strategists need to remember that the conflict in which political defiance is applied is a constantly changing field of struggle with continuing interplay of moves and countermoves. Nothing is static. - p. 34</span>
            <span class="c9">Due to these variations, specific actions by the resisters are likely to have consequences far beyond the particular time and place in which they occur. - p. 34</span>
            <span class="c9">Accomodation. It is important, therefore, that great care be exercised in selecting the issues on which a settlement by accommodation is acceptable. - p. 36</span>
            <span class="c9">Nonviolent coercion. Mass noncooperation and defiance can so change social and political situations, especially power relationships, that the dictator’s ability to control the economic, social, and political processes of government and the society is in fact taken away. - p 36</span>
            <span class="c9">Sometimes, a particular act by the dictatorship has so enrage the populace that they have launched into action without having any idea how the rising might end...A specific grievance may be recognized by others as similar to wrongs they had experienced and they, too, may thus join the struggle. - p. 39</span>
            <span class="c9">If one wishes to accomplish something, it is wise to plan how to do it. The more important the goal, or the graver the consequences of failure, the more important planning becomes. - p. 40</span>
            <span class="c9">“To plan a strategy” here means to calculate a course of action that will make it more likely to get from the present to the desired future situation. - p 40</span>
            <span class="c9">A grand strategy that limits its objective to merely destroying the incumbent dictatorship runs a great risk of producing another tyrant. - p. 40</span>
            <span class="c9">Why is it that the people who have the vision of bringing political freedom to their people should so rarely prepare a comprehensive strategic plan to achieve that goal? - p. 40</span>
            <span class="c9">Some inspaniduals and groups, of course, may not see the need for broad long-term planning of a liberation movement. Instead, they may naively think that if they simply espouse their goal strongly, firmly, and long enough, it will somehow come to pass. - p. 41</span>
            <span class="c9">Devoting so much energy to short-term activities, these leaders often fail to explore several alternative courses of action which could guide the overall efforts so that the goal is constantly approached. - p. 42</span>
            <span class="c9">Lacking real hope, these people will, nevertheless, defy the dictatorship for reasons of integrity and perhaps history. Though they will never admit it, perhaps never consciously recognize it, their actions appear to themselves as hopeless. Hence, for them, long-term comprehensive strategic planning has no merit. The result of such failures to plan strategically is often drastic: one’s strength is dissipated, one’s actions are ineffective, energy is wasted on minor issues, advantages are not utilized, and sacrifices are for naught. - p. 42</span>
            <span class="c9">Unfortunately, because comprehensive strategic plans for liberation are rarely, if ever, developed, dictatorships appear much more durable than they in fact are. They survive for years or decades longer than need be the case. - p. 43</span>
            <span class="c9">Grand strategy vs. strategy. A strategy has been compared to the artist’s concept, while a strategic plan is the architect’s blueprint. - Robert Helvey - p. 43</span>
            <span class="c9">Strategy also involves how to act to make good use of successes when gained. - p. 44</span>
            <span class="c9">To be most effective, tactics and methods must be chosen and applied with constant attention to the achievement of strategic objectives. Tactical gains that do not reinforce the attainment of strategic objectives may in the end turn out to be wasted energy. - p. 44</span>
            <span class="c9">Are the objectives worth a major struggle, and why? It is crucial to determine the real objective of the struggle. - p 47</span>
            <span class="c9">Fundamental questions:
            What are the main obstacles to achieving freedom?
            What factors will facilitate achieving freedom?
            What are the main strengths of the dictatorship?
            What are the various weaknesses of the dictatorship?
            To what degree are the sources of power for the dictatorship vulnerable?
            What are the strengths of the democratic forces and the general population?
            What are the weaknesses of the democratic forces and how can they be corrected?
            What is the status of third parties, not immediately involved in the conflict, who already assist or might assist, either the dictatorship or the democratic movement, and if so in what ways? - p. 48</span>
            <span class="c9">The types of action determined to be counterproductive will need to be excluded in the developed grand strategy. - p. 49</span>
            <span class="c9">To accomplish these objectives, the chosen means of struggle will need to contribute to a change in the distribution of effective power in society. - p. 49</span>
            <span class="c9">The experience of once exercising effective power is not quickly forgot. - p. 50</span>
            <span class="c9">In this analysis we have argued that the main force of the struggle must be borne from inside the country itself. - p. 50</span>
            <span class="c9">Planners of the grand strategy will need to sketch in broad strokes how the conflict might best be conducted. - p. 50</span>
            <span class="c9">How might the long-term struggle best begin? - p 51</span>
            <span class="c9">What institutions of the society can be regained from the dictator’s control, or what institutions need to be newly created by the democrats to meet their needs and establish spheres of democracy even while the dictatorship continues? - p. 51</span>
            <span class="c9">What types of symbolism can be most effective in mobilizing the population? - p. 51</span>
            <span class="c9">How can the society continue to meet its basic needs during the course of the struggle? - p. 51</span>
            <span class="c9">When the grand strategy of the struggle has been carefully planned there are sound reasons for making it widely known. The large numbers of people required to participate may be more willing and able to act if they understand the general conception, as well as specific instructions. This knowledge could potentially have a very positive effect on their morale, their willingness to participate, and to act appropriately. - p. 52</span>
            <span class="c9">Issues for strategists to consider: Determination of the specific objectives of the campaign and their contributions to implementing the grand strategy. - p 53</span>
            <span class="c9">What means of decision-making and communication will be possible during the course of the struggle to give continuing guidance to the resisters and the general population? - p. 54</span>
            <span class="c9">It will be necessary to determine how to withstand, counteract, or avoid this possible increased repression without submission. - p. 56</span>
            <span class="c9">Nor should the emotions of the moment – perhaps in response to new brutalities by the dictatorship – be allowed to spanert the democratic resistance from its grand strategy or the campaign strategy. - p. 57</span>
            <span class="c9">Careful implementation of the chosen grand strategy and of strategies for particular campaigns will greatly contribute to success. - p. 57</span>
            <span class="c9">These intermediary strategic objectives need to be attainable by the current or projected power capacity of the democratic forces. This helps to ensure a series of victories, which are good for morale. - p. 60</span>
            <span class="c9">Withdrawal of support is therefore the major required action to disintegrate a dictatorship. - p. 67</span> 
            <span class="c9">The changes won at a great price should not be lost through lack of planning. - p. 72</span>
            <span class="c9">It should be remembered that as many military wars are lost as are won. p. 72</span>
            <span class="c9">The wording of the constitution should be easily understood by the majority of the population. A constitution should not be so complex or ambiguous that only lawyers or other elites can claim to understand it. - p. 76</span>
            <span class="c9">Three major conclusions:
            Liberation from dictatorship is possible.
            Very careful thought and strategic planning will be required to achieve it.
            Vigilance, hard work, and disciplined struggle, often at great cost, will be needed. - p. 77</span>

            <span class="c3">The Rules of Improvisation That Will Change Your Life and Reduce Belly Fat
            The first rule of improvisation is AGREE. Always agree and SAY YES...Now, obviously in real life you’re not always going to agree with everything everyone says. But the Rule of Agreement reminds you to “respect what your partner has created” and to at least start from an open-minded place. Start with a YES and see where that takes you...As an improvisor, I always find it jarring when I meet someone in real life whose first answer is no...What kind of way is that to live?
            The second rule of improvisation is not only to say yes, but YES, AND. You are supposed to agree and then add something of your own...To me YES, AND means don’t be afraid to contribute. It’s your responsibility to contribute. Always make sure you’re adding something to the discussion. Your initiations are worthwhile.
            The next rule is MAKE STATEMENTS. This is a positive way of saying “Don’t ask questions all the time.”...In other words: Whatever the problem, be part of the solution. Don’t just sit around raising questions and pointing out obstacles. We’ve all worked with that person. That person is a drag.
            THERE ARE NO MISTAKES, only opportunities...In improv there are no mistakes, only beautiful happy accidents. And many of the world’s greatest discoveries have been by accident. I mean, look at the Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup, or Botox. - p 85</span>
            <span class="c3">You have to try your hardest to be at the top of your game and improve every joke you can until the last possible second, and then have to let it go. - p 123</span>

            <span class="c3">...Comedy is about confidence, and the moment an audience senses a slip in confidence, they’re nervous for you and can’t laugh...Make the entrance well-timed and exciting...There’s no harm in things looking fun, and you don’t get extra credit for keeping things indie and grim. - p 127</span>
            <span class="c3">“Don’t hire anyone you wouldn’t want to run into in the hallway at three in the morning.” - p 127</span>
            <span class="c3">She wasn’t there to play wives and girlfriends in the boys’ scenes. She was there to o what she wanted to do and she did not fucking care if you like it...”Is this person in between me and what I want to do?” If the answer is no, ignore it and move on. Your energy is better used doing your work and outpacing people that way. Then, when you’re in charge, don’t hire the people who were jerky to you. - p 144</span>
            <span class="c3">If your boss is a jerk, try to find someone above or around your boss who is not a jerk...Again, don’t waste your energy trying to educate or change opinions. Go “Over! Under! Through!” and opinions will change organically when you’re the boss. - p 145</span>

            <span class="c5">1 Reduce - The simplest way to achieve simplicity is through thoughtful reduction.
            2 Organize - Organization makes a system of many appear fewer.
            3 Time - Savings in time feel like simplicity.
            4 Learn - Knowledge makes everything simpler.
            5 Differences - Simplicity and complexity need each other.
            6 Context - What lies in the periphery of simplicity is definitely not peripheral.
            7 Emotion - More emotions are better than less.
            8 Trust - In simplicity we trust.
            9 Failure - Some things can never be made simple.
            10 The One - Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious, and adding the meaningful.</span>

            <span class="c5">How can you make the wait shorter? / How can you make the wait more tolerable?</span>
            <span class="c5">Basics are the beginning.
            Repeat yourself often.
            Avoid creating desperation.
            Inspire with examples.
            Never forget to repeat yourself.</span>
            <span class="c5">Observing what fails to make sense to the non-expert, and then following that trail successively to the very end of the knowledge chain is the critical path to success.</span>
            <span class="c5">Repetition works.</span>
            <span class="c5">A gentle, inspired start is the best way...</span>
            <span class="c5">The practice of education is the highest form of intellectual philanthropy.</span>
            <span class="c5">RELATE-TRANSLATE-SURPRISE relies on having a common experience upon which to map your own, which unfortunately limits the approach to specific cultures and customs.</span>
            <span class="c5">Difficult tasks seem easier when they are ‘need to know’ rather than ‘nice to know.’</span>
            <span class="c5">At the core of the best rewards is this fundamental desire for freedom in thinking, living and being.</span>
            <span class="c5">Simplicity and complexity need each other.</span>
            <span class="c5">We know how to appreciate something better when we can compare it to something else.</span>

            <span class="c5">When there is less, we appreciate everything much more.</span>
            <span class="c5">Ambience is the proverbial ‘secret sauce’ to any great meal or memorable interaction.</span>
            <span class="c5">Synthesizing the ambient experience of simplicity requires attention to everything that seemingly does not matter.</span>
            <span class="c5">How directed can I stand to feel? / How directionless can I afford to be?</span>
            <span class="c5">Form follows function...feeling follows form.</span>
            <span class="c5">Aichaku (love-fit) describes a deeper kind of emotional attachment that a person can feel for an object. It is a kind of symbiotic love for an object that deserves affection not for what is does, but for what it is.</span>

            <span class="c5">“To craft a good story, take the best of two extremes – fantasy and believability – and find a way to merge them.” - Disney Pixar</span>
            <span class="c5">“Deprived of support in our environment and the support of our own bodies, the only thing propping us up was our belief in accomplishing the mission—complete Hell Week. In psychology this belief is called self-efficacy. Even when the mission seems impossible, it is the strength of our belief that makes success possible. The absence of this belief guarantees failure. A strong belief in the mission fuels our ability to focus, put forth effort, and persist. Believing allows us to see the goal (complete Hell Week) and break the goal down into more manageable objectives (one evolution at a time). If the evolution is a boat race, it can be broken down into even smaller objectives such as paddling. Believing allows us to seek out strategies to accomplish the objectives, such as using the larger shoulder muscles to paddle rather than the smaller forearm muscles. Then, when the race is done, move on to the next evolution. Thinking too much about what happened and what is about to happen will wear you down. Live in the moment and take it one step at a time.” - Howard E. Wasdin, Navy SEAL</span>
